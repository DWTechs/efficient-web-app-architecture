title: Mono or multi repository

There are two main strategies for hosting and managing code through Git: mono-repo and multi-repo. Both approaches have their pros and cons.

We can use either approach for any codebase in any language. You can use any of these strategies for projects containing a handful of libraries to thousands of them. Even if it involves a few team members or hundreds, or you want to host private or open-source code.
