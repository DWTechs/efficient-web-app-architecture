# What is REST

REST is a set of architectural constraints. 
It is not a protocol nor a standard, so API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.
It is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP. However, most common REST API implementations use HTTP as the application protocol.
